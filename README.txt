Hello, this is Iss's MBTA Alerts Test. This uses https://api-v3.mbta.com/alerts for pulling the alerts. That means that you don't need a MBTA API Key, so the program works even without a MBTA API Key.

How To Run: First, Download Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download). Second, type "cd (the location of your file), then press Enter. After that, type "node mbta_tracker.js". and it should show all Current alerts. It shows ID, Effect, Severity, Description, and Date Created. Thank you for using the little test I made.
